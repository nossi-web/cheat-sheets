pwd : Path With Directory
	Use it to see what directory (folder) you're in, 
	Displays a string filepath

	$ pwd

cd : Call Directory
	Use it to call a certain directory, think of it as opening a folder, 
	or highlighting it, that folder has the focus, so to speak.
	It accepts either a directory (folder) name or a string path to a directory

	$ cd [folder/path/here]

ls : List
	Use it to have a look-see and list out the contents of the current directory
	accepts a number of arguments / flags, the most beneficial of which are:
	-l display results in long form
	-a display all files in the directory, including hidden ones
	-la combination of the above two

	$ ls

mkdir : Mage A Directory
	Calls a directory into being, think of it like the text-equivaline of 
	Make a New Folder

touch : Calls a file into being (think God and Adam on that Sistine Chapel ceiling)
	(yes, early programmers probably had God Complexes, what ya gonna do?)

	$ touch [filename.file]
